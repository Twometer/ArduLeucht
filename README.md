# tetrapix-v2
This project aims to create an up-to-date and easier-to-use version of the Tetrapix software. The current version does not run in limited environments (such as some school systems), and also uses outdated Arduino versions. The usability of the block building app could also be improved.

## Features
- Block code editor
- Easy to use
