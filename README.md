# tetrapix-v2

## Introduction
This project aims to create an up to date and easy to use coding software for the [Tetrapix](https://tetrapix.de) project. The latest official version does not run in limited environments (such as some school systems), and also uses outdated Arduino and Ardublock versions. The usability of the block code editor could also greatly be improved.
